YourTurn is an Open-Source project to play music from YouTube on your desktop (Windows and Linux). <br>
It's built with Electron, Node.js, ExpressJS, and uses the YTDL in combination with FFmpeg!.

> Be aware that YourTurn relies on the YouTube API which only allows third party apps to request information -- times daily. When the rate limit is reached all users are blocked from playing/streaming tracks. The stream will be re-enable one day after (at the same time) streams were blocked.
